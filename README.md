# Eaststar C2

I wanted to learn about ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs. After taking Daniel Duggan's [course](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/c2-development-in-csharp) on C2 development in C#, I decided to go more simplistic than the usual API development using Controllers.

So I made this.

It's not finished, I just wanted to save this project on github before the holidays, please generate Issues if you can think of better ways of implementation. I'm not an expert coder and I know there's too much code here so please let me know, thanks.
